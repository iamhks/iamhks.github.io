<!-- [Profession](#profession) &nbsp; [Avocation](#avocation) &nbsp; [Background & Interests](#background--interests) &nbsp; [Contact](#contact) -->


**Profession:** I am a Software Engineer II at Honeywell, where I have been working since graduating from college. In my role at Honeywell, one of the things I worked on was to independently develop and launch a full-stack SaaS offering, which served as an addition to the existing product, resulting in a new revenue source. And I mostly worked on projects with React, Node, Nest, SpringBoot, Typescript etc.

**Open-source Experience:** One of my proudest achievements has been my involvement with [**Unstructured Studio**](https://unstructured.studio/), an open-source organization under Outreachy. As a remote contributor, I synced with mentors in the US & Canadian timezone and worked on implementing UX/UI for new users and grouping feature for [ZubHub](https://zubhub.unstructured.studio/) (an open-source, documentation & collaboration tool for activity-based learning).
<!-- ## Avocation
My avocation keeps changing from time to time. It used to be paiting when I was a child to writing recently. Writing was my escape from the real world, a medium through which I can wander to places and thoughts without boundaries. I started writing through [The SHER's Blog](https://blog.iamhks.com) where I wrote articles on "Life" as a whole for about 3 years until I put my pen down. I guess it's safe to say that over-thinking and imagination is my current avocation. -->

**Education:** I completed my secondary schooling from [Nepal Bharat Maitri Vidyalaya](https://www.nbmv.edu.np/), Pokhara, Nepal; my high school from [Delhi Public School Siliguri](https://www.dpssiliguri.com/), West Bengal and my undergrad from [National Institute of Technology Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in), Telangana, India. 

**Background & Interests:** I was brought up in Biratnagar, Nepal and I currently reside in Hyderabad, India. Stuff I am interested in varies from human history & civilization, wildlife documentaries to adoring bollywood movies from the 2000s and ofcourse I am a fanatic of Indian music.
