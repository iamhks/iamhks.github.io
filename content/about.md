Hey! I’m Hemant, an Engineering student at National Institute of Technology Warangal. I am fascinated by the intersection between humans and computers i.e, I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and am passionate about finding new ways to use computing to maximize social impact. I’m an effective communicator, a productive team member, and a smart leader. Exploring the meaningful impact of technology is something that excites me to the core!
 

I also run [The Mind's Chatter](https://www.themindschatter.com) where I write articles on "Life" as a whole.
