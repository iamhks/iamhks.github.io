## Profession
Always being fascinated with Computers & Technology as any other kid growing up in the early to mid 2000s would be, I majored in Computer Science & Engineering during my undergrad and here are some of the projects I worked on : [HKS's Projects](https://iamhks.com/projects). 

## Avocation
My avocation keeps changing from time to time. It used to be paiting when I was a child to writing recently. Writing was my escape from the real world, a medium through which I can wander to places and thoughts without boundaries. I started writing through [The SHER's Blog](https://blog.iamhks.com) where I wrote articles on "Life" as a whole for about 3 years until I put my pen down. I guess it's safe to say that over-thinking and imagination is my current avocation.

## Background & Interests
I was brought up in Biratnagar, Nepal. I completed my secondary schooling from [Nepal Bharat Maitri Vidyalaya](https://www.nbmv.edu.np/), Pokhara, Nepal; my high school from [Delhi Public School Siliguri](https://www.dpssiliguri.com/), West Bengal and my undergrad from [National Institute of Technology Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in), Telangana, India. 

Stuff I am interested in varies from human history & civilization, wildlife documentaries to adoring bollywood movies from the 2000s and ofcourse I am a fanatic of Indian music.
