Hey! My name is Hemant and I am from Nepal. I was brought up in Biratnagar, completed my schooling in Pokhara and attended high-school in Siliguri. I was fortunate enough to get into National Institute of Technology Warangal which is where I am pursuing my Bacholer's in Computer Science and Engineering. I chose to major in CSE because exploring the meaningful impact of technology is something that excites me to the core! 

I also run [The Mind's Chatter](https://www.themindschatter.com) where I write articles on "Life" as a whole.
