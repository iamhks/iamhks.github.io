      <description>Hey! My name is Hemant and I am from Nepal. I was brought up in Biratnagar, completed my schooling in Pokhara and attended high-school in Siliguri. I was fortunate enough to get into National Institute of Technology Warangal which is where I am pursuing my Bacholer&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science and Engineering.
Additionally, I run The Mind&amp;rsquo;s Chatter where I write articles on &amp;ldquo;Life&amp;rdquo; as a whole.</description>

      <description>Welcome! Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find answers to some of the most unpleasant/difficult questions that pops up in our minds every now and then. Since everything in the world is relative; some answers may or may not be satisfactory. Most of the answers are short and succint to consume the least amount of time. Some answers are a little lengthy though because they need elaboration.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it common when our friend needs some help, we&amp;rsquo;re able to give a good advice; but when we&amp;rsquo;re in a similar situation we struggle through it?</description>
