      <description>Hey! My name is Hemant and I am from Nepal. I was brought up in Biratnagar, completed my schooling in Pokhara and attended high-school in Siliguri. I was fortunate enough to get into National Institute of Technology Warangal which is where I am pursuing my Bacholer&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science and Engineering. I chose to major in CSE because exploring the meaningful impact of technology is something that excites me to the core!</description>
