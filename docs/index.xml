      <description>Welcome! Here you’ll find answers to some of the most unpleasant/difficult questions that pop up in our minds every now and then. Since everything in the world is relative; some answers may or may not be satisfactory. Most of the answers are short and succinct to consume the least amount of time. Some answers are a little lengthy though because they need elaboration.
Isn’t it common when our friend needs some help, we’re able to give good advice; but when we’re in a similar situation we struggle through it?</description>

      <description>Hey! My name is Hemant and I am from Nepal. I was brought up in Biratnagar, completed my schooling in Pokhara and attended high-school in Siliguri. I was fortunate enough to get into National Institute of Technology Warangal which is where I am pursuing my Bacholer&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science and Engineering. I chose to major in CSE because exploring the meaningful impact of technology is something that excites me to the core!</description>
