<p><strong>Profession:</strong> I am a Software Engineer II at Honeywell, where I have been working since graduating from college. In my role at Honeywell, one of the things I worked on was to independently develop and launch a full-stack SaaS offering, which served as an addition to the existing product, resulting in a new revenue source. And I mostly worked on projects with React, Node, Nest, SpringBoot, Typescript etc.</p>
<p><strong>Open-source Experience:</strong> One of my proudest achievements has been my involvement with <a href="https://unstructured.studio/"><strong>Unstructured Studio</strong></a>, an open-source organization under Outreachy. As a remote contributor, I synced with mentors in the US &amp; Canadian timezone and worked on implementing UX/UI for new users and grouping feature for <a href="https://zubhub.unstructured.studio/">ZubHub</a> (an open-source, documentation &amp; collaboration tool for activity-based learning).</p>

<p><strong>Background &amp; Interests:</strong> I was brought up in Biratnagar, Nepal and I currently reside in Hyderabad, India. Stuff I am interested in varies from human history &amp; civilization, wildlife documentaries to adoring bollywood movies from the 2000s and ofcourse I am a fanatic of Indian music.</p>
